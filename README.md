# Digit Recognition Model (HDRM)
*by Khyk*

Here's my first AI project. The initial idea was to create model which will be capable of recognize a handwritten digit out of a small grayscaled image, and without any module (like `torch`).

> **Note:** I had this idea after watching a educational video. Please check it to fully understand the project and to give 1Blue3Brown some credit ([Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk)) (His videos are awsome)

It was very interesting for me, hope you'll enjoy this as good as me. :)
